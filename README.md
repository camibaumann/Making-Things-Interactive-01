# Making-Things-Interactive-01
Mechanized Ink Painting 

  For this project, I was interested in representing the progression of the human experience withn a mechanical machine. I began with a common children's toy, a paint spinner, and sought to represent its evolution into "adulthood"; i.e. into a mechanical form.

  One of my main inspirations for this project was Damien Hirst, an artist who uses paint spinning as a medium for his work. I wanted to capture the same playfullness and aesthetic of his work. However, I wanted to question the interaction and control of the art. In classical painting, the boundaries of control of the artist are between the artist's hand and the paintbrush. With this project, I wanted to question the nature of the paintbrush, of the artist's "tool". My claim is that the essence of an artist's tool is a sensor, an interpreter of the artist's intent. Here, the interpreter, or sensor, or artist's tool is the potentiometer and touch sensor.

First Step: 

For this project, I developed a file to lasercut the frame of the ink painting machine. Below is an image of how I organized and developed the file.

With this, I was able to depend on a solid framework in order to build my prototype.
